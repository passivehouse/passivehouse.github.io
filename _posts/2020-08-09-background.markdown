I worked with my wife before actually meeting her. It's a bit convoluted but we both work in technology in financial services. I worked in London, she worked in New York. I worked on projects that needed both input and work from her. Back then, it was definitely a case of I needed her more than she needed me so I had to be at my most charming self to get what I wanted. She's now very quick to call out the annoying British guy constantly bugging her for stuff but alas, one has to get stuff done. I've always been of the mindset to treat others as you would have them treat you in getting things done. Also, work life is more enjoyable when you're straightforward and ask nicely rather than being an asshole and ordering, calling rank, etc. Digressing ..

Anyway, long short, we went separately on our merry ways in 2008 after both losing our jobs following the seismic events of that year affecting our industry. I went to the safest place I could find (a Canadian bank) with the Mrs funnily enough landing at a British bank (with more annoying British guys trying to influence her).

Eventually, I got expat'ed to New York in 2010. We got together some time after that, married and now have a Daughter (the apple of my eye, thorn in my side, etc).

After marriage and pre-Daughter, we started looking for somewhere to live. We were living in Dumbo in a one-bedroom apartment but it was time to grow up. We both loved our apartment. It was a converted shoe factory with massively high ceilings. We had a southern exposure which meant it was a pretty bright and cheerful home. That was until the tourists and developers moved in. Dumbo underwent some pretty dramatic changes in the time that we were there. Seemingly overnight, our area became cool and rents started rising. Eventually, we decided we weren't cool enough and wanted something different out of life so the hunt started.

Being in financial services, we have this spreadsheet fastidiously containing every open house we went to, the asking price and tracked actual selling prices pretty religiously. We went to almost 100 open houses over the course of a year. We looked at houses, condos, co-ops … a bit of everything pretty much anywhere.

We made a couple of half-hearted offers. We made some pretty aggressive, over-the-top offers … we weren't really getting anywhere. In one case, we actually had the best offer but lost out to a couple with twins who strategically deployed them to charm the owners at a final open house before highest-and-best offers. They ended up writing heart-warming letter with twins' bedroom selections. How does one compete with that?! In another case, the property went for 50% over asking. New York City … place property on the market undervalued to generate hype, open house then highest-and-best offers. Sold in a week. Seriously, pretty good work if you can find it.

Anyway, randomly, we looked at something at this place we had never heard of called Ditmas Park. Wow, this was completely different to anything we'd seen previously! We found old Victorian houses on tree-lined streets. And people saying hello to us walking around the neighbourhood. I mean, who does that? And what did they want from us?
Commutes would be acceptable with express trains to the city. Houses even had driveways so we could have a car. Decent schools for the inevitable children. Why wasn't this place more on the map? We still can't figure out why.

We eventually found something on a lovely block. Unfortunately or fortunately, a lot of the historic detail had been lost in the house. For me, this wasn't the end of the world as I turn it into what we wanted without the associated guilt of destroying history. This was ripe for some Grand Designing!

We closed in 2016 figuring that we would live there for a year to figure out what worked and didn't work. We consciously decided to do the absolute minimal amount of work to avoid any regrettable spend knowing that we were going to do something substantial later.
One year of waiting to work turned into two as we were joined by the Daughter in late 2017. 2018 was blur of nappies (OK, diapers), crying and laughter (OK, I've now accepted losing condo to heart-warming letter from parents … I get it).

So, 2019 … the project begins. Specifically, a smart Passive House renovation project.
As per the previous post, I've watched a lot of Grand Designs. In all this Grand Designs watching, I've noticed that Kevin McCloud has a soft spot for environmentally conscious building thus I've grown up influenced by Kevin's soothing and sagely words around environmental impact. I can't remember which episode it was but Grand Designs introduced me to something called Passivhaus (in English, Passive Houses). So I started reading.

As per Wikipedia, Passivhaus is a rigourous, voluntary standard for energy efficiency which reduces a building's ecological footprint. Basically, it involves buildings oriented to take best advantage of the sun that aren't leaky to (cold/hot) outdoor air built with craploads of insulation and really good windows. This all allows you to reduce your energy consumption (hence reducing your ecological footprint) to an absolute minimum and reduce your environmental impact.

Now, I don't think either of us would describe ourselves as eco-crusaders. I think we qualify as environmentally conscious. For example, we're both carnivores which and I'm particularly partial to a bit of beef. Livestock farming has a pretty devastating impact to the environment (8% of total greenhouse gas emissions according to this with methane being particularly harmful due to its capacity to hold more energy). We're not exactly about to change that. And we fly a lot.

On the other hand, I don't drive which was a conscious decision long ago based on the number of cars that we have on the road (28% of USA greenhouse gas emissions attributed to transportation in 2016 according to EPA but unfortunately, I don't know how much trust one can place in the EPA given Scott Pruitt and Trump's sanitising American scientific messaging). Instead, I prefer to cycle and will advocate cycling as the future of transportation to anyone who will listen.

So we're environmentally conscious. Climate change through Enhanced Global Warming is real despite what the idiots in charge are telling us. If I'm not willing to give up on beef, I better do my bit and besides, it's much more comfortable way of living. Who wouldn't want a constant flow of fresh air into their house? Yep, Passive Houses have to constantly mechanically turn over stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air as they're built to be as air tight as possible. Given that the EPA estimates Commercial/Residential and Electricity contributes 11% and 28% of US greenhouse gas emissions respectively, it makes sense to try to set an example of what can be done.

Also, as a new parent, I guess this is the ultimate nesting instinct kicking in as I want to create a safe, healthy environment to raise my children. As a Technologist, I'm going to be innovative and I believe that Passive Houses are the future (they literally are as New York housing standards are tightened up, we're building to their 2050 target standards TODO find sources).

It's also as a Technologist that I want to create a "smart" home. I read something about this guy who wrote scripts to automate any task requiring more than 90 seconds of his time. This guy is my hero! It's something I advocate and preach at work all the time. The Technologist/Programmer part of me doesn't want to turn on hallway lights when I unlock the front door. I should be scripting that.

As a tech-savvy home owner, I want data from my Passive House. One of my goals will be to rig up every room in the house with thermo-hygrographs (Raspberry-Pis galore) and record temperature and humidity data (time-series database with visualisations) to optimise for energy consumption. I'm aiming to record the energy consumption of every electrical device and teach my house how to use less energy. I don't get to code much (if at all) in my job anymore and this is an itch that I've had for the longest time. I often get mocked for wanting to code at work as well as bragging about it so it's time to dazzle.

Understanding light levels, temperature and humidity is also really important to us as the Mrs is an avid plant collector. We're going to do our best to make sure she has lots of space and the right environment to flourish!

So there you have it, a Smart Passive House. I've decided to write about it because I truly believe that this is the future of house construction.

My younger self was full of radical ideas but that's softened with time. We're just a normal family. We have opinions and ideas on bigger things (politics, environment, Brexit, etc) but don't really get the opportunity to ever do anything about them. We don't really get involved in trying to push change with full-time jobs and the Daughter.

I guess the point behind this is if it works (and I'm certain it will), then the knowledge will be put out there for all to see and inspire. I'll be trying some innovative stuff around the data collection aspect to measure the performance of the build too. I'll open-source the code for all to use.
