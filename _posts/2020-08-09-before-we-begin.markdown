Growing up, I watched an awful lot of a TV show called Grand Designs. I like to think I learnt a lot of life lessons from it.

Hosted by Kevin McCloud, he would track an overly ambitious house build/renovation project from start to finish. You gained a glimpse into people's lives, the stress of building and the joy of completion. I would eagerly watch people describing their projects and motivations.

I would particularly enjoy watching Kevin ask about budgets. He would either give them his opinion straight to their faces or walk away, face the camera and tell it how it was. If he did the latter, you'd generally know you were in for a treat.

At the end of the project, Kevin does a walkthrough and review with the owners before delivering his verdict. In the review, he never fails to ask how much they actually spent. For me, this is one of the best moments of the show. Most of the time, people completely blow through their budgets making for some entertaining television. The bright-eyed early optimism is normally hit with a potent dose of reality as the build starts and things go wrong. So when asked how much they actually spent, you get the entire gamut of responses. Fully transparent to murky to cloudy to obsidian black. I'd never miss this bit. If was out of the room, I always rewind to this bit. The transparent guys are generally the A+ students who've done a great job keeping things in check. Less transparency either comes from a bit of embarrassment at not having thought things through as much (or possibly just the pure obscenity at someone's spend).

So what did I learn from all this watching? As of writing, season 19 has finished in the UK (and it's now available on Netflix in the USA).

Pragmatism about budgets? Possibly. My job involves a pretty hefty dose of this. My wife would argue otherwise.

Project management skills? Some. Again, the Mrs would argue otherwise.

Building your dream home is probably one of the most stressful but rewarding experiences you can tackle? Yea!

My romantic side enjoys watching the level of fulfillment and accomplishment that these projects deliver. Watching it over the years, you always think that you could do better. You wouldn't fall into the traps. You'd see everything coming a mile away. I decided long ago that I'd have a crack one day.

Our time has come and I'm gonna write about it.
